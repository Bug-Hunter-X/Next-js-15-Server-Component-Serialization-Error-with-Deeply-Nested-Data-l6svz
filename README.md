# Next.js 15 Server Component Serialization Error with Deeply Nested Data

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Next.js 15 server components when dealing with deeply nested or complex data structures.  The problem arises when the serialized data exceeds default limits or causes issues during rehydration, leading to errors or inconsistencies in the UI.

## Bug Description

When fetching and using deeply nested data within a server component, Next.js might encounter serialization issues.  This can result in errors during data transfer between the server and client, causing the UI to render incorrectly or throw errors.

## Solution

The solution involves optimizing the data structure to reduce its depth and complexity, using data transformation techniques or implementing custom serialization logic to handle large datasets.
